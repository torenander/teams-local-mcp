// AccountParamDescription is the shared description text applied to the
// `account` parameter of every tool that supports account selection (CR-0056
// FR-42, FR-49, FR-50). The text is deliberately explicit about three things:
//
//  1. Both the account label AND its User Principal Name (UPN, e.g.,
//     "alice@contoso.com") are accepted. The resolver performs label lookup
//     first, then UPN fallback.
//  2. Auto-selection is NOT a generic "default account" behavior. Omitting
//     `account` only auto-selects when exactly one account is authenticated
//     AND zero other accounts (connected or disconnected) are registered.
//     When the single authenticated account coexists with disconnected
//     siblings the resolver still auto-selects but emits an advisory so the
//     LLM can surface the disconnected siblings to the user.
//  3. The LLM must never silently assume a "default account" — it must
//     inspect the current account landscape (via account_list or prior
//     context), consider disconnected accounts, and ask the user when intent
//     is ambiguous.

	"Never assume a default account: inspect account_list (or the current account landscape) and consider every registered account, including disconnected ones, before acting. " +
	"Omitting this parameter yields silent auto-selection ONLY when exactly one account is authenticated and no other accounts (connected or disconnected) are registered. " +
	"When a single authenticated account coexists with disconnected accounts, auto-selection still occurs but the response surfaces an advisory naming the disconnected accounts — raise that advisory to the user rather than ignoring it. " +

// GraphClient retrieves the Microsoft Graph client from the request context.

//   - ctx: the request context containing the injected Graph client.

// Returns the Graph client, or an error if the client is not present.
