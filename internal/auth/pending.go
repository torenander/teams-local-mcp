// Package auth background authentication bookkeeping.
//
// This file holds the record of an in-flight background authentication
// attempt. It exists as its own file because the synchronisation contract
// below is easy to get wrong: before CR-0067 the middleware stored the
// completion channel and the resulting error as plain struct fields, written
// by the background goroutine and read at middleware entry with no
// synchronisation at all — a data race that `go test -race` reports.
package auth

import "time"

// backgroundAuthTimeout bounds a background interactive authentication
// goroutine, for both the browser and device code flows. Entra ID device codes
// expire after roughly 15 minutes, but the server does not wait that long: an
// abandoned login must release the pending authentication flag so the session
// is not frozen indefinitely (CR-0067 A4). Before CR-0067 both flows ran on an
// unbounded context.Background(). The value matches the bound used by the
// add_account handler.
const backgroundAuthTimeout = 300 * time.Second

// pendingAuthAttempt records a single background authentication attempt.
//
// The attempt object is immutable once published: the goroutine running the
// attempt assigns err exactly once and then closes done. Because a channel
// close happens-before any receive that observes it, every reader that has
// seen done close is guaranteed to observe the final err without holding a
// lock. Readers must therefore never touch err before done is closed.
type pendingAuthAttempt struct {
	// done is closed when the attempt finishes, successfully or not.

	// err is the outcome of the attempt: nil on success. Valid to read only
	// after done is closed.
	err error
}

//
// Returns the attempt. No side effects.

// Parameters:
//   - err: the authentication error, or nil on success.
//
// Side effects: closes a.done. Must be called exactly once per attempt;
// calling it twice panics on the double close, which is intentional — it
// signals a bug in the caller's goroutine bookkeeping.

// begin publishes a fresh attempt on the middleware state and marks the

// When no attempt has ever been published, running is false and err is nil.
